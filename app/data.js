I have no problem using bootstrap.js to get the job done, just that the code can be easily reused/refactored if placed in directives, and that\'s already been done for you with this project. Plus, the datepicker and typeahead are missing from bootstrap, two very useful components.<br><a href="http://mgcrea.github.io/angular-strap/" target="_blank">angular-strap</a>',
